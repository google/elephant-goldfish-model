# Test Plan: Goldfish Review Loop Skill

Frontmatter and link checks run in `pytest tests/unit` (see [TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md)).

## Protocol Verification Checklist

When evaluating or exploring `egm-review-loop` interactively in chat, verify:

-   **Step 1 (Intake & Config):** Validates required inputs, resolves standard paths, and saves each URL in `GoldfishContext` as a file before the first round, asking for a local copy of any page that cannot be saved.
-   **Step 2.1 (Target Resolution):** Unconditionally re-scans line numbers before auditing.
-   **Step 2.2 (Review Swarm):** Spawns subagents across requested standards. With no subagent tool, stops and tells the user that a review in the same context is not a Goldfish review.
-   **Step 2.3 & 2.4 (Resolve Handoff & Turn Boundary):** Hands findings to `egm-resolve` and respects human decision gates.
-   **Step 2.4 (Round Control):** Keeps contested and accepted findings settled, re-opens fixed findings that reviewers raise again, judges clean rounds before applying fixes, records failed reviewers (and reviewers with no status in the synthesizer summary) as not run, stops after two consecutive clean rounds, and asks the user at the 5-round cap or on churn.
